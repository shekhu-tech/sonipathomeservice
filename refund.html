    <h1>Refund & Cancellation Policy</h1>
    

    <p>
At Sonipat Home Service, we are committed to providing reliable and quality services to our customers across Sonipat (urban & rural areas). This Refund & Cancellation Policy explains the conditions under which refunds and cancellations are processed for services booked through our website (www.sonipathomeservice.com
) and mobile applications.

Service Cancellation by Customer

Customers may cancel a booking at least 2 hours before the scheduled service time without any cancellation fee.

Cancellations made less than 2 hours before service time may attract a cancellation fee (up to 30% of the service charges).

For prepaid bookings, refunds (if applicable) will be processed after deducting cancellation charges.

Service Cancellation by Sonipat Home Service

We reserve the right to cancel or reschedule any service due to reasons such as unavailability of technicians, emergencies, or unforeseen issues.

In such cases, customers will be offered either:

A full refund (for prepaid services), or

An option to reschedule the service without extra charges.

Refund Eligibility

You may be eligible for a refund if:

The booked service is not delivered due to provider unavailability.

You have prepaid for a service and cancelled it within the allowed cancellation time.

A duplicate payment was made due to technical error.

Non-Refundable Cases

Refunds will not be provided in the following situations:

If the service has already been delivered successfully.

If the customer is not available at the service location at the scheduled time.

If the issue arises due to customer-provided equipment/materials (e.g., faulty spare parts provided by customer).

Refund Process

Approved refunds will be processed within 7–10 working days.

Refunds will be credited to the original payment method (Bank/UPI/Wallet/Card) used during booking.
